    <h2>Hello! Welcome to Lovebird!</h2>
    <p class="tutorial">
    To add a person to your Lovebird list, click the <strong>heart next to their name</strong> on any email from them in the regular Thunderbird view. Or, you can search for a person to add by typing part of their name or email address into the "<strong>add a person</strong>" box above. Once you've added some people, they'll appear in the list on the left.</p>
    <p class="tutorial">
    Click a name in the list on the left, and all your conversations with that person will appear above. Double-click a person's name to write them a new email.
    </p>
    <p class="tutorial">
    <img src="chrome://lovebird/skin/needs-reply.png"/> This icon means that the person has written you a message which may need a reply. Double-click the thread title to write a response. Once you've responded, the icon will disappear.
    </p>
    <p class="tutorial">
    If a message needs no reply, you can click the <img src="chrome://lovebird/skin/needs-reply.png"/> icon in the conversation list to turn it off. Click there again to turn it back on.
    </p>
    <p class="tutorial">
    The default sort order of the people list shows you who has been waiting the longest for a reply to a conversation. You can sort it in different orders using the sort-order buttons in the upper-left corner.
    </p>
    <p class="tutorial">
    You can open a conversation in a regular Thunderbird tab by right-clicking the conversation title and choosing "<strong>Open in new tab</strong>".
